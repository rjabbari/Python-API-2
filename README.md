# Python-API-2
UCI Python API Open Weather Map 2

A total of 563 unique cities were selected to show how temperature, humidity, cloudiness and wind speed are effected by their distance to the equator.

1. The data supports the fact that either in the northern or southern hemispheres closer to the equator the hotter the temperature. Please see scatter plot of Maximun Temperature versus Latitude.
2. Humidity is not a function of closeness to the equator.  However, the scatter plot for himidty shows more cities are created in areas of higher humidity. Less cities have been founded in arid climates.
3. Cloudiness is also not a factor relevant to the equator. 
4. Wind speed is also not a factor relevant to the equator. However, cities are founded in areas of lower wind speeds, the higher wind speeds supports less cities.
5. All scatter plots show that there are more cities in the northern hemisphere as compared to the southern hemisphere.
